# theory-of-concurrent-computing
### Background
This repository contains work from the theory of concurrent computing classes at the University of Science and Technology in Cracow (AGH Kraków).
### Content
The subject obtains the following topics:
* How to implement binary semaphores and counting semaphores in java using wait() and notify() and synchronization block
* Thread Synchronization and a race problem
* Implementation of condition wait
* Producers and Consumers Problem
* Buffer implementation
* Pipeline computing with buffer
* Compare Java Concurrency Utilities and standard java solution at produces and consumers problem.
